# Test Transaction Data - Slot 10 (2025 Season)
# NOTE: Raw CBS transaction data needs to be re-captured from CBS Sports
# This file should contain tab-separated FA transaction data for testing

# Expected format (from CBS FA Transactions copy/paste):
# Date	Team	Players	Effective
# 12/30/24 1:42 AM ET	Team Name	Player Name POS • NFL - Signed for $0	17

# Parser issues fixed in this session (2026-01-19):
# 1. Multi-player rows - CBS combines "Signed" + "Dropped" in one row
# 2. Emoji stripping - Lock/box emojis break regex matching
# 3. Duplicate detection - Timezone issue with date parsing
# 4. Trade parsing - "Traded from [Team]" format

# Test cases that should work after fixes:
# - "Dillon Gabriel QB • CLE - Signed for $0.00 Cooper Kupp WR • SEA - Dropped" -> 2 transactions
# - "Jordan Love QB • GB - Traded from Sweet Chin Music" -> 1 TRADE transaction
# - Rows with emojis should have emojis stripped before parsing

# TODO: Re-capture raw CBS transaction data for slot 10 to validate parser fixes
