# .clinerules - KLeague Manager Development Rules

## CRITICAL: Verified Development Framework

This project follows the Verified Development Framework. Every action must be transparent and independently verifiable by the user.

### MANDATORY WORKFLOW (NEVER SKIP):
1. READ PRD.md, TASKS.md, DEVELOPMENT.md before ANY coding
2. CREATE detailed specification for current task
3. WAIT for explicit user approval on specification
4. IMPLEMENT incrementally (one small piece at a time)
5. PROVIDE exact verification commands the user can run
6. SHOW expected vs actual output
7. WAIT for user to verify independently
8. ONLY proceed after explicit user approval

### ABSOLUTE RULES:
- NEVER write code without approved specification
- NEVER claim something works without verification commands
- NEVER use mock/fake/simulated data
- NEVER skip user approval step
- ALWAYS provide commands user can run themselves
- ALWAYS show database state via Prisma Studio or queries
- DEFAULT to asking clarifying questions rather than assuming

## Team Identity System (CRITICAL - Added 2026-01-18)

**Problem:** CBS Sports retroactively renames historical data when teams rebrand.

**Solution:** Slots (permanent league positions 1-10)
- `TeamSlot` table: 10 permanent records, never changes
- `TeamAlias` table: Maps team names → slots with year ranges
- Keeper logic follows SLOT, not team name

**Lookup:** `getSlotIdFromTeamName(name, year)` handles all variations.

**Example:**
- "Discount Belichick" (2023-2024) = Slot 5
- "Seal Team Nix" (2025, CBS applied retroactively) = Slot 5

---

## Season Configuration

**Total Rounds:**
- 2023, 2024: `totalRounds = 27`
- 2025+: `totalRounds = 28`

---

## Keeper Cost Calculation (CRITICAL - CORRECTED 2026-01-16)

**The Rules:**
1. Year 2 (1st keeper year): Keep at original cost (draft round or R15 for FA)
2. Year 3+ (2nd+ keeper year): Keep at (previous year - 4)
3. Ineligibility: If cost < 1, player is INELIGIBLE

**Examples:**
- Round 6: Y2=R6, Y3=R2, Y4=INELIGIBLE
- Round 10: Y2=R10, Y3=R6, Y4=R2, Y5=INELIGIBLE
- Free Agent: Y2=R15, Y3=R11, Y4=R7, Y5=R3, Y6=INELIGIBLE

**Keeper Base Acquisition Rule (FINAL - 2026-01-20):**

CBS Behavior: When you KEEP a player, CBS creates a NEW "DRAFT" record each year.
So kept players have MULTIPLE DRAFT records on the same slot across seasons.

Algorithm:
1. Find ALL acquisitions for player on this SLOT (any season)
2. If multiple exist → Return EARLIEST (keeper clock started there)
3. If only one (fresh):
   - DRAFT → Use this draft (fresh start)
   - TRADE → Find earliest DRAFT across ALL teams
   - FA same season as a DRAFT → Inherit that draft round
   - FA never drafted that season → True FA, use Round 15

## Database: PlayerAcquisition.droppedDate

- `null` = player still on roster
- `DateTime` = player was dropped
- Roster queries filter `droppedDate: null`
